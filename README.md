This is my project—a digital, cyber-style I Ching divination website.
The I Ching, also known as the Book of Changes, is one of the oldest Chinese classics, with origins dating back to around 1000 BCE or earlier. It is both a philosophical text and a divination system designed to help people reflect on life, nature, and transformation. The I Ching consists of 64 hexagrams—symbols made of six lines (either broken or unbroken)—each representing a specific situation or pattern of change. Ancient scholars believed that all things in the universe are constantly shifting, and the I Ching offers wisdom on how to understand and harmonize with these changes.

This divination method is ancient. In the earliest I Ching rituals, people would use three coins, toss them six times, and record the patterns of heads and tails to derive a hexagram representing their fortune. The practitioner would then interpret the result using traditional texts and symbolism. Unlike Western systems like astrology or tarot, I Ching focuses more on the transformation within a specific moment—how to understand the current situation and move with the flow rather than against it. It teaches that everything in the universe is in flux, and the goal of divination is not to predict a fixed future, but to find wisdom in adapting to change.

Traditionally, this kind of divination was considered mystical—and surprisingly accurate. It’s a form of Eastern occultism, often practiced by Taoist priests or spiritual practitioners. If someone without spiritual training attempted it, the ritual might still be effective—but at the cost of their own life force, especially if they asked taboo questions. In this digital version, I simplified the ritual. Instead of tossing three coins six times, the system only performs one toss of three coins. While this may not be as precise, it offers a more casual experience—and helps protect your lifespan (more for fun!).

In this project, when the user clicks to divine, three binary digits are generated. These are visually represented through animated GIFs of coin flips, so the user's "input" is made visible. I found that some degree of user engagement was essential, so this coin visualization helps make the ritual feel more interactive. Once the binary is generated, it is used to determine a corresponding hexagram. On the API side, I connected the system to OpenAI's model using a plugin. The hexagram name is sent to the AI, which then generates an interpretive message.

My hope is to use this light-hearted and playful format to help people become more curious about and connected to the I Ching tradition.

P.S. after you perform one divination, the code is designed to hide the input fields for casting and asking questions. This is intentional—you are not supposed to keep asking until you get an answer you like, and you certainly shouldn't ask the I Ching about everything. You can't, you just can't
